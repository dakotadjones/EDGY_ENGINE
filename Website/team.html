			<p>The EDGY engine is a 2D game engine. It uses TypeScript and WebGL to render 2D assets in an HTML5 Canvas.
				The engine relies on assets prerendered in exponential perspective. The EDGY engine is designed as a proof-of-concept
				for mathematics developed by the project's mentor and sponsor, Dr. James Palmer.
