			1 ASSETS
		</p>
		<p class="subtitle">
			1.1 Assets should be 3D assets rendered in 2D. 
		</p>
		<p class="first">
			The game that is developed using the EDGY engine will use 2D assets entirely. This means that the walls, floors, ceilings, etc., will all two-dimensional images, scaled and placed in the canvas by the engine, and will describe a three-dimensional space. WebGL has the capability of rendering in 3D using the GLSL-based vertex and fragment shaders which would not require perspective in order to scale the object. 2D assets, however, may be pre-rendered and then scaled based on their distance from the viewer. The use of this technique is the primary requirement of the project.
		</p>
		<p class="subtitle">
			1.2 All assets should have interesting visual characteristics.
		</p>
		<p class="first">
			Interesting visual characteristics include things such as hair, texture, causticity, etc. Rendering simple assets does not take much time and defeats the purpose of fast scaling using exponential perspective.
		</p>
		<p class="subtitle">
			1.3 Expected Assets
		<p class="first">
			1.3.1 Floor tiles
		<p class="second">
			Floor tiles will be required to describe areas such as narrow hallways and open areas. This will require several different kinds and shapes of assets.
		</p>
		<p class="first">
			1.3.2.Wall tiles
		</p>
		<p class="second">
			Wall tiles will be required for indoor areas such as hallways.
		<p class="first">
			1.3.3 Ceiling
		</p>
		<p class="second">
			As with wall tiles, indoor areas will require a ceiling.
		</p>
		<p class="first">
			1.3.4 Characters
		</p>
		<p class="second">
			Characters are useful for showing off the benefit of exponential scaling. Creating characters with complex and interesting visual characteristics is required and will serve useful for accomplishing the primary requirement.
		</p>
		</p>

			2 ENGINE
		</p>
		<p class="subtitle">
		2.1 Scaling method for assets should use exponential perspective.
		<p class="subtitle">
		2.2 Mathematical Justification
		<p class="title">
			3 GAME CONTENT
		</p>
		<p class="subtitle">
			3.1 Game should be family-friendly with no blood
		</p>
		<p class="first">
			Self-explanatory. The game level made using the EDGY engine should not contain anything inappropriate.
		</p>
		<p class="subtitle">
			3.2 Game should only be one level 
		</p>
		<p class="first">
			The focus of the project is on the game engine rather than developing a sprawling game. The level should prove the concept in a succinct and obvious way.
		</p>
		<p class="subtitle">
			3.3 Game should render different kinds of elements
		</p>
		<p class="first">
			The game engine's purpose is to use exponential perspective to scale pre-rendered assets in a fast and realistic way, so several different kinds of assets should be used to both increase realism and describe the concept using more than simple rectangular-shaped tiles.
		</p>
		<p class="subtitle">	
			3.4 Game should contain an open area and closed in area
		</p>
		<p class="first">
			Both types of areas (open and closed) can be described using exponential perspective and the game should exemplify that.
		</p>
		<p class="title">
			4 USER TESTING
		</p>
		<p class="first">
			A user-test is required for the completion of the project. The game should go through series of user testing to test for: <br>
			 - Smoothness <br>
			 - Realisticness <br>
			 - To check on the quality of solutions to unique problems with using exponential perspective as a rendering method. For example, what should it look like when the player turns 90 degrees?
		</p>
		<p class="title">
			5 QUALITATIVE STUDY
		</p>
		<p class="first">
			A qualitative study as a result of the user testing is a requirement for the completion of the project. The results of the qualitative study should show that the use of exponential perspective feels realistic and that the game runs smoothly and quickly.
